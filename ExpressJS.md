# ExpressJS

ExpressJS is a JavaScript framework for backend development and its made to run outside the browser, a popular runtime for it is Node, simply download install it and to run a javascript file do:
`node fileName.js` or to support live changes, use nodemon `nodemon fileName.js`

To start an project do:
`npm init` and answer the questions that fit.

In order to use the new import modules, instead of the old way using "require", you need to add the line `"type": "module"` at the root level of the object inside `package.json`, file generated by the npm init command.

Every import has to be first installed to your project folder with the command `npm install package_name` or `npm i package_name` for short.

`package.json` will keep track of your dependencies, which are installed at the folder `node_modules`. To reinstall everything again, simply do `npm i` at the directory containing the `package.json` file and the node_modules will be generated again, so there's no need to commit it. Please do not commit `node_modules` or `package-lock.json`

## Basic Structure

```js
import express from "express" // Imports express under the name express
import bodyParser from "body-parser" // Imports the middleware bodyParser
const app = express()         // Create the "app"
const port = 3000             // Define a port to run the app

// use the middleware body-parser to our app, it will provide a body to our request and response objects.
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })) 

app.get('/', (req, res) => {  // Add a GET route to "/" 
  console.log(req.body) // prints the body of the request, thanks body-parser.
  res.send('Hello World!')    // Return Hello World! in the http response
})

// Start listening in the port specified, the second argument is a callback function that will be run after listen completes and will print to the console.
app.listen(port, () => { 
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```
